# facial-emotion-recognition-CNN

This project focuses on classifying human emotions from facial images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning techniques. It leverages deep learning to identify emotions such as Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise from grayscale facial images.

### Project Overview
Facial emotion recognition plays a key role in applications such as:

üé• Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction

üè´ E-learning engagement monitoring

üè• Mental health analysis

üõ°Ô∏è Security and surveillance

In this project, we compare and evaluate four different deep learning approaches:

Custom CNN Model from Scratch

Custom CNN with Data Augmentation

VGG16 (Transfer Learning)

ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates how deep learning models, especially with transfer learning, can effectively recognize facial emotions. While the Custom CNN provided a good baseline, VGG16 and ResNet50 significantly boosted accuracy and generalization. With further fine-tuning and larger datasets, this approach can be used in real-world emotion detection applications.
